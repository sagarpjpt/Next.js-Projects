### dashboard/(auth) --- its not a route/resource name its just a grouping name which contain related route together for eg /login/page.jsx, /register/page.jsx

### layout and components

- src/app/layout.js apply to all pages
- loading layout -- loading.jsx is default loader provided by next.js 
- default error page error.jsx
- Root layout wraps everything (HTML, body, global stuff)

Route layout wraps only that route and its children
