# Next.js Project

## About

This repository contains a Next.js project built as part of my learning and hands-on practice with modern frontend development. The project was created by following YouTube tutorials as reference, while writing and understanding the code independently.

The focus of this repository is on understanding core Next.js concepts, project structure, and real-world React usage rather than just completing a demo.
